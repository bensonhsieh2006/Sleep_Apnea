The study utilizes a combination of CNN and LSTM architecture. The spectrogram of each time step is initially processed by a CNN. The resulting image features are then flattened and inputted into an LSTM for prediction, as shown in Fig. 4. The proposed model is based on the combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and audio data, taking into account the time series nature of the data and the temporal correlation between data. This combination is chosen due to the suitability of CNN for image classification.
