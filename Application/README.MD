 The system architecture comprises three main components: the client application, the AI algorithm and the Server Process, the Data Storage part. The Java ServerSocket framework was utilized to develop the client application, which establishes communication with the server through a web API. We also used MVC (Mode, View, Control) mechanism for the system. In the AI algorithm, we developed two models which are Hopping Window Model and Sliding Window Model. Each window employed a CNN-LSTM kernel for model training. The training data and real-time collected data were stored in a private cloud storage.
